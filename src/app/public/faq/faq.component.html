                            You are not able to see the follow button because you are logged in as yourself and cannot follow yourself but rest assured that others can see it under your profile!

                        <p>
                            The slug is, in fact, the end part of the URL link to your post. It auto-generates from the title you choose. Both manual and auto-generated slugs are good ways to go about it. Manual slugs are slightly better in the sense that you can add ''keywords'' to your link making your post more searchable and therefore, more SEO-friendly.

                        <ol>

                            <li> On the youtube video page, click on share and select the embedded tab</li>

                            <li> There will be a code line from which you have to copy the url link contained in the middle of it. Here it is in bold and blue:

                             <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/slGXjuW_wxE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>

                            <li> back on MTS, in the text box, click on the second to last tool on the top line called "iframe". It will open a small window asking for the URL so you just have to paste in the link you previously copied. You can also put in the width and height information, which can be found in the code line (shown in pink above).</li>

                            My Trending Stories is a new website which seeks to inform readers about the latest news and events occurring globally as well as serving as an outlet and platform for creatives who are interested on sharing their opinions and views on various topics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The website serves as a creative platform which enforces a sense of community between creatives allowing you to connect with other members and share your views openly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In terms of the posts themselves, no topic is off limits or imposed as long as it does not contribute to racism, discrimination or anything that violates an individual’s human rights or any laws. Furthermore, you have the liberty to post directly on the website with an author login.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In terms of frequency there is no imposed minimum nor maximum, feel free to share what inspires you the most.

                        <p>
                            As of right now, all of creatives are contributors so it's not remunerated and currently there are no advertisements on My Trending Stories, thus no revenue is being generated by the website.
